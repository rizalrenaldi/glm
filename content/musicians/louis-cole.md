category: Singer / drummer / multi-instrumentalist / songwriter / producer
band: Knower, Clown Core
description: LA-based singer songwriter, producer and multi instrumentalist co-founded the alt pop/electro funk band Knower.
notes: I started to got exposed to Louis Cole from Youtube. A multi instrumentalist, playing some groovy/funk stuff. His creative ideas are ahead of its time. Eventhough he's multi instrumentalist, which is usually generalist, but in his case I almost can identify his signature whether he's singing, drumming or playing keyboard, I can tell right away it is him. This was happened when the first time I found out about Clown Core. On second listens, I have suspicion it was Louis. Turns out I was right!
