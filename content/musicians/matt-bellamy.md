description: Matt Bellamy is best known as the lead singer, guitarist, pianist, and primary songwriter of the rock band Muse. He is recognised for his eccentric stage persona, wide tenor vocal range and musicianship. He has also released solo compositions.
notes: For me, Matt and Muse always has a special part in my music journey. Through his music, he taught us to see beyond future, to always one step ahead, and just dont give a fuck about anything else. The world will be ready. Not all people, but some people might be ready. "Plug in Baby" and "Sunburn" are among Muse's songs that shaped my younger years.
