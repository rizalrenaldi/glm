notes: I can not describes enough how RATM affects me personally. It is so important to the point where I will not be who I am today if it is not because of RATM. Critical thinking, always questions thing. Without lowering other RATM member role in shaping RATM music as a whole, but in my opnion, RATM will not be RATM if it's not because of Tom Morello. His guitar playing is so ahead of its time, it blows everyone's mind, and it's still today.
