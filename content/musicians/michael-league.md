description: Michael League is the bandleader of New York-based instrumental band Snarky Puppy and the international music ensemble Bokant√©. He also founded the band Forq with keyboardist Henry Hey, and is also an owner and founder of the record label GroundUP Music. League has won three Grammy Awards.
notes: Honestly I didn't know much about Michael League, but his music stamped in my head for quite a while. To be able to lead a non-committed band consists of a dozen musicians, while composing songs, is truly a rare ability. On a side note, Snarky Puppy's groundUP live recording video on Youtube will be one the most important music artefact for many many years ahead.
