name: Jimi Hendrix
surname: James Marshall "Jimi" Hendrix
category: Guitarist / Singer / Songwriter
band: The Jimi Hendrix Experience
description: Jimi Hendrix was an American musician, singer, and songwriter. Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as "arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music"
notes: I have been into Blues since my junior high school days, and still until this day. Interestingly, my first encounter to Blues is not Hendrix, but later I learn that you can listen to all Blues you can think of, but if you absence to Hendrix, it is never been complete. Hendrix expanded modern Blues above and beyond.
