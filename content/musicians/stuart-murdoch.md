description: Stuart Murdoch is Scottish musician and the lead singer and songwriter for the indie pop band Belle and Sebastian.
notes: For me one of the amazing thing about Stuart is that he has the ability to turn something daily, common things that we forget, into beautiful, poetic story. His unique point of view to see things make almost every song of B&S is so light but being told so beautiful. I have the highest praise for Stuart.
