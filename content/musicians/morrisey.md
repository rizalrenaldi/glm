description: Morrissey is an English singer, songwriter, and author. He came to prominence as the frontman of rock band the Smiths, who were active from 1982 to 1987. Since then, he has pursued a successful solo career. Morrissey's music is characterised by his baritone voice and distinctive lyrics with recurring themes of emotional isolation, sexual longing, self-deprecating and black humour, and anti-establishment stances.
notes: I was a bit late to know Morissey. After I dig thorough his lyrics, I instanly says that this gentlement is pure genius. His lyrics is so quircky and unique as if he has a pair of eyes that totally different from the rest of us human. On a side note, the brit's humour is always fit with my taste of humour, whether it's dark or light humour.
