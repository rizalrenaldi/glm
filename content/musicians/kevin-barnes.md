description: Kevin Barnes is the singer, multi-instrumentalist, and songwriter for the indie rock group of Montreal, part of the Elephant 6 Collective. Barnes started the band on their own and, although providing several stories as to the origin of the name, is said to have named it after a failed romance with a woman of Montreal, Canada. The group has recorded fifteen full-length albums, and numerous EPs and 7" singles. Their brother, David Barnes, is an artist and has designed most of the band's artwork for albums since the release of The Gay Parade.
notes: The most whimsical mind. Wicked point of view, prolific lyrics, complicated wordplay, weird theme choosing. His creativity is out of this world.
